1. **Concept and context**
Exercise 1.8 introduces an Asian option, which is a path-dependent financial derivative whose final payoff is based on the average stock price over the life of the contract, rather than depending solely on the final price. The conceptual objective of this exercise is to apply the computational reduction techniques (seen in Section 1.3) by introducing a new cumulative state variable (the sum of past prices) so that the backward pricing algorithm remains efficient (Section 1.6, pp. 22-23).

2. **Formal definitions**
* $S_0$: Initial stock price.
* $u, d$: Up and down factors of the stock price, respectively.
* $r$: Constant interest rate per period.
* $\tilde{p}, \tilde{q}$: Risk-neutral probabilities.
* $n$: Time index or period.
* $K$: Strike price.
* $S_k$: Stock price at time $k$.
* $Y_n$: Cumulative sum of the stock prices between time zero and time $n$.
* $v_n(s, y)$: Price of the Asian option at time $n$, conditioned on the current stock price being $S_n = s$ and the cumulative sum of prices being $Y_n = y$.
* $\Delta_n(s, y)$: Number of shares of the underlying stock that the replicating portfolio must hold at time $n$ if $S_n = s$ and $Y_n = y$.

3. **Key equations**
*(Note: The author does not assign explicit equation numbers within this specific exercise. The mathematical definitions formulated in the problem statement are presented with the exact notation).*


$$Y_n = \sum_{k=0}^n S_k$$
$$v_3(s, y) = \left(\frac{y}{4} - 4\right)^+$$

4. **Assumptions and domain of validity**
* The exercise assumes the validity of the standard parameters of the binomial model presented in Example 1.2.1 ($0 < d < 1+r < u$).
* Given that the option payoff depends on the historical average, the reduction of the pricing model strictly requires including both the current stock price ($S_n$) and the historical sum ($Y_n$). Omitting the variable $Y_n$ would invalidate the algorithm, as the path dependency would prevent calculating the final payoff correctly without knowing the complete path of coin tosses.

5. **Theorems and proof outline**
Not covered in this section (being a practical modeling exercise, it does not introduce formal theorems or its own mathematical proofs).

6. **Exercises in this section**
* **Exercise 1.8 (Asian option):** Based on the three-period model of Example 1.2.1 where $S_0=4$, $u=2$, $d=1/2$, $r=1/4$, and where the risk-neutral probabilities turn out to be $\tilde{p}=\tilde{q}=1/2$. It is defined that $Y_n = \sum_{k=0}^n S_k$. Consider an Asian call option that expires at $n=3$ with strike price $K=4$, whose final payoff is $\left(\frac{Y_3}{4} - 4\right)^+$. Defining $v_n(s, y)$ as the price of this option at time $n$ if $S_n = s$ and $Y_n = y$, the exercise exclusively asks to:
* (i) Develop an algorithm for computing $v_n$ recursively. In particular, write a formula for $v_n$ in terms of $v_{n+1}$.
* (ii) Apply the algorithm developed in (i) to compute $v_0(4, 4)$, which is the price of the Asian option at time zero.
* (iii) Provide a formula for $\Delta_n(s, y)$, the number of shares of the underlying stock that must be held in the replicating portfolio at time $n$ if $S_n = s$ and $Y_n = y$.

* **Section 1.2 (Example 1.2.1):** The exercise directly imports the structure and numerical values of the binomial tree presented in this basic example.
* **Section 1.3 (Computational Considerations):** This exercise directly applies the reasoning presented in Example 1.3.2 (Lookback Option), requiring state grouping through an additional cumulative variable to avoid the exponential complexity calculation of all coin toss paths.
* **Chapter 2 (Markov Processes):** The definition of the functions $v_n(s,y)$ rigorously anticipates the use of two-dimensional state vectors in Markov Processes, which the author mathematically formalizes in Section 2.5 and exemplifies in Exercises 2.13 and 2.14 with this same Asian option.
